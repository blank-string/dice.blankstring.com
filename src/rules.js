    <p><b>You will need</b></p>
    <p>You only need a 6 side die, you may want a coin</p>
    <p><b>Players</b></p>
    <p>Each player starts off with 100 health and 1 potion</p>
    <p>Create a series of questions for your players. Here are some basic questions:</p><ul><li><i>What is your characters name?</i></li><li><i>What is you characters age?</i></li><li><i>What is you characters gender (if applicable)?</i></li><li><i>What is your characters build (e.g. height, weight, arms, legs, hair etc.)?</i></li><li><i>What traits does you character have (e.g. disabilities, mannerisms)?</i></li><li><i>Does you character have any special abilities, if so exaplin (bear in mind that it should have a cost or a drawback e.g. you can not have hyper beam with no rechard?)</i></li></ul>
    <p>then a series of questions related to the quest to give the characters depth and help them to make decisions which their character might actually make e.g. </p>
    <p>You should come up with a list of items, abilities or magic and asign each one a number. Have each player roll and then either give them a choice of item or give them said item for the quest</p>
    <p><b>Mechanics</b></p>
    <p>Ask everyone to roll to see order</p>
    <p>Everyone takes turns and decides on a thing to do</p>
    <p>There are a few things you could consider when it comes to decide what happens</p>
    <p><i>Standard Action</i></p>
    <p>Roll a dice and decide on outcome. You may give someone advantage which is +1 to roll (can't go higher than 6) or -1 to roll (can't go below 1)</p><ol><li>Critical failure, usually leathal</li><li>Failure, do not get what they ask</li><li>Success, but usually with a bit of give and take, more take than give</li><li>Success, but usually with a bit of give and take, more give than take</li><li>Sucess, pretty much give them what they want with nothing extra</li><li>Critical success, give tham more than they want</li></ol>
    <p>it is best to decide on this before hand, but do comparimise with your players and sometimes it is good to agree before the roll on the outcome</p>
    <p><i>Violent Action</i></p>
    <p>Like when someone is attacking for example</p>
    <p>depending on what the character wants to do, usually 10 times the roll for damage, if it is difficult you may want to roll before hand to see how successful they are, e.g. if they are trying to throw a spear into the center of something or some sort of crazy acrobatics</p>
    <p>You may also do 5 times the roll if it is something like area damage or something which isn't very strong</p>
    <p><i>Challenge Action</i></p>
    <p>Highest roll wins, e.g. bluffing, see if you do a good bluff or if they don't believe your bluff. Maybe a strength contest</p>
    <p><i>Potion</i></p>
    <p>Players can take their potion unless they die, at which point someone can give them a potion. Usually heals so they can continue the mission. For example if you have 90% of the mission to finish and they are nearly dead then it will heal a lot where as if it is before final boss fight and they are nearly fully healed then just heal fully</p>
    <p><i>Map</i></p>
    <p>You have 2 choices. Either no map and you draw it as the game progresses, using a list of things which need to eventually show up. Or you have a complete map. You can also use markers for the players to mark where they are.</p>
    <p><i>Comments</i></p>
    <p>Ultimatly you want everyone to have an easy laugh which does not require a deep knowledge of anything. Creating a story should be simple and you should not have all the details planned out but usually good to have a "What if they don't do this" kind of thing but most of the time people want to do the mission you have set out. Normally you want it to last a couple of 1-2 hours at most any longer and it is a shore. Sometimes you might add extra rules like "Down your drink when you drink a potion" to make it funnier</p>
